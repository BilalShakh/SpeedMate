* The saves the data in the documents directory on an Android Device with the name specified by the user(default name is SpeedData.xls).
* The app uses the Android device's GPS and Storage so permissions are required for the app to fucntion correctly.

Future Plans:
-------------
* Setup the elevation and change in speed and time settings in the setting menu.
* Optimize small features in the app to increase app's reasource effeciency.
